## Template for a R Package repository

Content related to the package:

- `DESCRIPTION`: contains information about the package name/description and dependencies. `Imports` is used to import CRAN packages, while dependencies installed from github must be present also in the `Remotes` field.

- `NAMESPACE`: contains all the imported packages and functions. Automatically generated by `devtools::document()`, should not be modified.

- `man`: contains the manual reference for the exported functions. Automatically generated by `devtools::document()` and files should not be modified.

- `R`: contains all the `R` scripts of the package.


## To create an empty package from RStudio

1. `File`
2. `New Project`
3. `New Directory`
4. `R Package`
5. Set the package name and the location on disk


## Other functions

To load the functions without installing the package (from inside the package directory):

- `devtools::load_all()`

To document the package with Roxygen (updating `NAMESPACE` and the manual):

- `devtools::document()`

To add a dataset to the package:

- `usethis::use_data(trees)` to add the object `trees` as package data.

To build the site locally:

- `pkgdown::build_site()`
  
  Calling `build_site()` will generate a folder `docs` with the `.html` files of the website built locally. 
  If the GitHub Actions workflow to build the website is working (`pkgdown` in this repository), the website will be automatically built each time a change is pushed, so `docs` should be in the `.gitignore` since it is not useful.

To create an article:

- `usethis::use_article("hello")`
  
  This will generate a file `hello.Rmd` in the `vignettes` folder.
